Because we sent 12 as a string.JS will always gonna try to perform type coercion.
so it will convert 1 to a string. And then we know that by string concatenation it will output "12"

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript

- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>Write your explanation here</i>

In the nums there are only 1 zero. As it will return false in if condition so count won't be added 1. Other values are true value. So count going to increment 3 times. That's why the answer is 3.
